# Getting Started

To get started with the Device Controller there are 2 methods.

## NPM

First import the npm package using either `Puck`, `Pixl` or `Bangle`. In the example below we are using `Puck`.

```javascript
import { Puck } from "@espruino-tools/device-controller";
```

_if you are creating your own device you can import DeviceController as shown below_

```javascript
import { DeviceController } from "@espruino-tools/device-controller";
```

## Script Tags
