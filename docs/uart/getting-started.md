# Getting Started

_This packaged is not primarily intended to be used on its own but as it's functionality is essential to how the DeviceController package works it makes sense to have documentation of its inner workings_

## Installation

### NPM

This package can be install directly through npm by using the following command

```
npm install @espruino-tools/uart
```

from here this can be imported like so

```javascript
import { uart } from "@espruino-tools/uart";
```
